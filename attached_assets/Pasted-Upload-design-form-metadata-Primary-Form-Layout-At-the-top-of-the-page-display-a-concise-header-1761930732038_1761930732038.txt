Upload design — form + metadata
Primary Form Layout
At the top of the page, display a concise header:
“Upload Your Design” — followed by a short helper text:
“Provide the required details and files for your design submission. All uploaded designs will undergo a review before being published.”
The form is divided into two main sections — Design Details and Files Upload — with a collapsible Metadata Panel at the end.
1. Design Details Section
This section captures the core attributes of the design:
Title — Text input for the design’s name (required).
Short Description — Multi-line text box (max 500 characters).
Category / Subcategory — Two dropdowns with auto-suggestions and search; the subcategory list dynamically updates based on the chosen category.
Tags — Chip-based input allowing multiple tags to improve discoverability.
Price — A toggle for Free / Paid.
If Free, the price input field remains hidden.
If Paid, an amount input box appears immediately below the toggle, requiring a valid numeric price entry (₹).
2. File Upload Section
Designers must choose between two upload modes — Single Design Upload or Bulk Upload.
A toggle or radio button at the top lets them select the upload type.
Single Design Upload
When the designer opts to upload a single design, they must upload exactly five files — one in each of the following formats:
.eps
.cdr
.jpg
.png
.svg
Each file input field is clearly labeled with the required format name and displays a checkmark once successfully uploaded.
 The UI should not allow submission until all five file slots are filled.
If a file with an incorrect format is uploaded, display an inline validation message like:
 “Invalid file type. Please upload a valid .eps file.”
Bulk Upload
If the designer selects the Bulk Upload option, they must upload a single .zip file.
 This zip file must contain multiple folders or zip files, and each of those must include the same five files (.eps, .cdr, .jpg, .png, .svg) corresponding to individual designs.
Validation checks should confirm:
File type = .zip
Reasonable size limit (as defined by system constraints)
If validation fails, show an inline error message such as:
“Your bulk upload must be a .zip file containing subfolders, each with .eps, .cdr, .jpg, .png, and .svg files.”
There should be a bulk download template available for reference for designers.
