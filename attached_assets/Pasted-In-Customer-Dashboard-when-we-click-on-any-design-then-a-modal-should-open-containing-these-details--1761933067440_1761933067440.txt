In Customer Dashboard when we click on any design then a modal should open containing these details

Design Modal
Create a responsive Product Modal component in Next.js + Tailwind CSS that displays product details, sub-products, and plan-based download or purchase actions which is called by clicking on design.
Modal Layout
Centered white card with rounded-2xl corners, shadow-xl, and smooth fade/scale animation using Framer Motion.
Sections:
Header:
Product image on left (from product.media[0])
Product title, category, and status on right
Close (X) button on top-right


Body:
Product description
Product Plan Type (Premium, Basic, etc.)
Sub-products listed in a responsive table:
 | Product # | Color | Price | Stock | Status |
Each sub-product row can have a small “Add to Cart” button (for quick add).


Footer:
If user has an active plan:
 Show:
“Download Design” (primary button)
“Add to Cart for Bulk Download” (secondary button)


If user does NOT have an active plan:
 Show:
“Add to Cart”
“Buy Now”
“Purchase Plan” (highlighted button)
All buttons should be rounded-full, Tailwind-styled, and have hover transitions.
Below the buttons, show metadata:
 Created By, Created At, Updated By, Updated At (small gray text).
