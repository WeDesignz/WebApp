Description
Build a Customer Dashboard for the WeDesignz platform. It should be modern, dark-themed by default, responsive, and ready for future feature expansion.
Layout Structure
1. Left Sidebar Menu
At the top: WeDesignz logo.


Then main menu items (keep placeholder icons + text):
Dashboard
My Downloads
Categories
Freelancers
Support


Sidebar should be collapsible (expand/collapse on hover or toggle).


Bottom of Sidebar:
Notifications icon
Support/Help icon
WhatsApp Community join icon (links externally)
Theme toggle (dark/light)


Sidebar should have a card for: custom design creation (icon + text), these custom orders will be delivered in 1hrs.
Sidebar should be scalable so in future, new categories like vectors, psd, icons, illustrations, mockups, 3D models can be easily added.


2. Top Bar
At the top center:
Large search bar with placeholder “Search designs, vectors, mockups...”
Right beside it: category filter dropdown.


At the top right corner:
Profile/settings icon → when clicked, open dropdown with options:
Profile / Account
Theme
Support
Subscription / Plans
Logout

3. Main Dashboard Content
Category Card Slider (icon + title):
Below the search bar, create a horizontal scrollable row of category cards (e.g., Jerseys, Vectors, PSDs, Icons, Mockups, Illustrations, 3D Models).
 Each card: image/icon + category title. Smooth hover animation.


Invite Freelancers Section:
 Add a visible section/button with “+ Invite Freelancers to List Their Designs”.
 You can place it right below category cards or floating at a visible position.
 It should look like a CTA (Call-To-Action) card.


Image Feed Section (Infinite Scroll):
 Grid layout (like Pinterest or Freepik style).
Each image card has hover effects:
If Free, show a Download icon on hover.
If Premium, show a Premium badge/icon always visible. On hover, show an icon/button “View Plans” which redirects to Plans page.


Infinite scroll should load more images dynamically (use mock data initially).



Functional Requirements
Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Sidebar collapses into icons on small screens.
Use Tailwind transitions and Framer Motion (optional) for animations.
